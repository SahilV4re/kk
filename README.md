# Krowd Kam

## The Problem
Due to the steep rise in population, and the limited space and resources in metropolitan cities and other areas with large population densities, there have been many accidents in the recent past, such as stampedes in Mumbai and Kumbh Mela, and recently due to the lack of social distancing in this pandemic era.

This calls for the need of an automated crowd management system today, not only for private orgaizations but also in public places by the government.

## Our Solution
An application which serves as a central crowd management system for an orgaization such as railway station or an amusement park, which helps them to track crowd in various zones in their orgainzation and provide each organization hourly analysis reports to detect the trends in crowds according to time and place using snapshots from CCTV cameras.

Apart from this we would also like to provide general users who use the application a live crowd tracking feature which enables them to look at the population density in different areas in different locations in real-time which helps them to plan their trips to various locations in the city accordingly.
